# Compiler-Construction-CC0815
A Java compiler, implemented from scratch. 

This project was realized during the class on [Compiler Construction](http://cksystemsteaching.github.io/CC-Summer-2013/), 
held by [Christoph Kirsch](http://cs.uni-salzburg.at/~ck/).

[CC0815.java](CC0815.java) is the compiler itself, the EBNF grammar is described in [EBNF.txt](EBNF.txt). 

For more information, check out the [documentation](CC0815_doc.pdf) and [talk slides](CC0815_talk.pdf).
